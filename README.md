# Seismic_Activity_Classification
Creating a rule that accurately distinguishes signals generated by nuclear explosions from those generated by earthquakes enables scientists to learn if a foreign power is developing nuclear weapons.

Earthquake vs Explosion Classification using KNN and SVM
This project analyzes a geophysical dataset to classify seismic events as either earthquakes or nuclear explosions, using supervised machine learning methods (KNN and SVM) and exploratory clustering (K-Means).

CLASSIFICATION

âœ… KNN (k = 3)
Cross-Validation Error: ~7.4%
Test Error: 10%

Decision Boundary - KNN

Decision boundary learned using k = 3, shown in standardized space.

âœ… SVM (Linear, Polynomial, Radial)
All three SVM models achieved perfect test classification (0% error).

Linear Kernel Decision Boundary

Polynomial Kernel (Degree = 1)

Radial Kernel


ðŸ“‰ Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOOCV)

Model	        LOOCV Error
KNN (k=3)	      ~7.4%
SVM (Linear)	    0%


ðŸ“ˆ Clustering Analysis (K-Means)

Although classification performed well, clustering using K-Means was also explored for unsupervised pattern recognition.


Elbow Method

Within-cluster variability vs. number of clusters (K).

MODEL COMPARISON

Method	           Test Error	          LOOCV Error	      Notes
KNN (k=3)	           10%	                ~7.4%	       Simple, effective
SVM (Linear)	       0%	                   0%	         Best performance, simplest kernel
SVM (Poly/Radial)  	 0%	                   0%	         Overkill for this dataset


CONCLUSION

Both KNN and SVM are effective for this classification problem.
SVM with a linear kernel achieved perfect performance with minimal complexity.
Visualizations support clear class separability in feature space.
K-Means clustering shows some structure but isn't sufficient for classification alone.
